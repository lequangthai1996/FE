  <h1>Tommy the cat</h1>
  <p>Well I remember it as though it were a meal ago...</p>
  <p>Said Tommy the Cat as he reeled back to clear whatever foreign matter
    may have nestled its way into his mighty throat. Many a fat alley rat
    had met its demise while staring point blank down the cavernous barrel of
    this awesome prowling machine. Truly a wonder of nature this urban
    predator — Tommy the cat had many a story to tell. But it was a rare
    occasion such as this that he did.</p>
